# EMCDR - A Classical Embedding and Mapping Approach for Cross-Domain Recommendation, Reproduction and Extension

For the limitation that the maximum size of the upload file is 25MB, I have deleted some data .pkl file or restored model parameters. So for the complete version of the folder, I have uploaded to the BaiduNetDisk which you can access through the link (<https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Zq_7BHc-FP8rFxkDNOPoMQ?pwd=7gzb>).


In the end, thanks to user **MaJining92** one more time, his implementation work has helped me a lot, which you can access from [here](<https://github.com/MaJining92/EMCDR>).
